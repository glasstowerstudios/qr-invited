### Welcome to then QR-Invited Developer Documentation
This is the documentation for the QR-Invited API and source code. This is probably only useful to developers. If you're looking for how to install and use the QR-Invited software for your wedding, you're probably wanting http://www.qr-invited.com instead.

### Authors and Contributors
QR-Invited (including both the server and client applications) was originall written in 2011 by Scott Johnson (@jwir3).

### Support or Contact
If you're having trouble with an individual QR-Invited wedding website, it's best to contact the owner of that website (i.e. typically either the bride or groom). If you're having trouble with the server API, or you can't reach the owner of a given QR-Invited site, you can contact [Scott](mailto:jaywir3+qrinvited@gmail.com).
